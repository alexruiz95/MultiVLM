# MultiVLM
Visual Studio project including a code (Fortran; development version) to obtain the potential non-linear aerodynamic characteristics of flat plates plantforms for steady detached flow condition.

The results obtained through the current code correspond to the shown in the manuscript "A detached flow model based on the Vortex Lattice Method" (Pimentel, 2021) and the presentation "The Full Multi-wake VLM" uploaded for public release in Researchgate.com portal.
